# Mars Project Modernization

## Overview

This project modernizes and resurrects the Mars application using contemporary technologies and best practices, offering an immersive and interactive experience for exploring the Red Planet.

## Project Structure

-   `public/js/web.js`: Main application logic (for Browser)
-   `public/css/styles.css`: Custom styles for the application
-   `public/images/hero.avif`: Hero image for landing page
-   `index.js`: Entry point for the Express server
-   `views/*.ejs`: EJS templates for dynamic content
-   `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration for code quality
-   `Dockerfile`: Container configuration for deployment
-   `docker-compose.yml`: Multi-container Docker setup
-   `ci-cd.yml`: CI/CD pipeline configuration
-   `prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration for monitoring
-   `grafana-dashboard.json`: Grafana dashboard for visualizing metrics

## Features

-   Interactive 3D Mars terrain visualization
-   Real-time weather simulation with dedicated weather view
-   Responsive design for various devices
-   Server-side rendering with EJS templates
-   Data visualization tools for Mars statistics
-   Dynamic theming based on Mars time of day
-   Multi-language support for global accessibility
-   Containerized deployment with Docker
-   Automated CI/CD pipeline
-   Prometheus and Grafana integration for monitoring and analytics

## Technology Stack

-   Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   Backend: Node.js with Express.js
-   3D Rendering: Three.js
-   Templating: EJS
-   Linting: ESLint with custom configuration

-   CI/CD: GitHub Actions
-   Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Development

-   Use ESLint for code linting with custom rules
-   Use Git flow for version control
-   Utilize EJS templates for server-side rendering

## Deployment
