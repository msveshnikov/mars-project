-   `index.js`: Entry point for the Express server
-   `landing.html`: Static landing page
-   `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
-   `views/main.ejs`: Main EJS template for dynamic content
-   `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration for code quality

## Features

-   Interactive 3D Mars terrain visualization
-   Real-time weather simulation
-   Multi-language support with dynamic content localization
-   Responsive design for various devices
-   User accounts and personalized experiences
-   Server-side rendering with EJS templates
-   Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
-   Data visualization tools for Mars statistics

## Technology Stack

-   Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   Backend: Node.js with Express.js
