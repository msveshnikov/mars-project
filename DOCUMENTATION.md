## Project Overview

The Mars Project Modernization is an ambitious endeavor to revitalize and enhance the Mars application using cutting-edge technologies and best practices. This project aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience for exploring the Red Planet, leveraging modern web technologies and cloud-native architecture.

The application offers a range of features including 3D terrain visualization, real-time weather simulation, multi-language support, and responsive design, making it accessible across various devices and platforms.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern, scalable architecture:

-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
-   **3D Rendering**: Three.js
-   **Templating**: EJS
-   **Containerization**: Docker
-   **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
-   **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
-   **Logging**: Fluentd and Elasticsearch

### Key Components:

1. **Express Server**: The core of the backend, handling HTTP requests and serving dynamic content.
2. **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time communication between the server and clients.
3. **EJS Templates**: Server-side rendering for dynamic content.
4. **Three.js**: Powers the 3D terrain visualization.
5. **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment.
6. **Prometheus**: Collects and stores application metrics.
7. **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and creates dashboards.
8. **Fluentd**: Collects and forwards logs.
9. **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes logs for easy searching and analysis.

## Features

-   Interactive 3D Mars terrain visualization
-   Real-time weather simulation
-   Multi-language support with dynamic content localization
-   Responsive design for various devices
-   Server-side rendering with EJS templates
-   Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
-   Data visualization tools for Mars statistics
-   Offline mode support
-   Dynamic theming based on Mars time of day

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/msveshnikov/mars-project.git
    cd mars-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.

4. Start the development server:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

After starting the server, access the application through a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Key pages and features:

-   `/`: Landing page with project overview
-   `/explore`: Interactive 3D Mars terrain
-   `/weather`: Real-time Mars weather simulation
-   `/stats`: Data visualization of Mars statistics

## Module Interactions

1. `index.js`: Entry point for the Express server. It sets up middleware, routes, and socket connections.

2. `utils/generators.js`: Contains functions for generating terrain, weather, and statistics data.

3. `routes/index.js`: Defines the application routes and their handlers.

4. `socket/index.js`: Sets up real-time communication using Socket.IO.

5. `middleware/index.js`: Configures Express middleware for security, compression, and logging.

6. `public/js/web.js`: Main client-side JavaScript for handling user interactions and 3D rendering.

7. `views/main.ejs`: Main EJS template for rendering dynamic content.

8. `public/manifest.json`: Web App Manifest for PWA support.

## Development

-   Use ESLint for code linting: `npm run lint`
-   Format code with Prettier: `npm run format`
-   Run tests: `npm test`
-   Use Git flow for version control
-   Implement lazy loading for performance optimization

## Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```
    docker build -t mars-project .
    ```

2. Run the container:

    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. For cloud deployment, push the image to a container registry and deploy using cloud-native services (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Instances).

4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

5. Use a CDN for static asset delivery to improve global performance.

## Future Enhancements

-   Virtual Reality (VR) support using WebXR
-   Augmented Reality (AR) features for mobile devices
-   Collaborative exploration features with WebRTC
-   Integration with NASA APIs for real-time Mars data
-   WebGL-based terrain generation for custom Mars landscapes
-   Voice commands and natural language processing for navigation
